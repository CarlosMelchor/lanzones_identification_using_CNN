# IDENTIFICATION OF A LANZONES TYPE THROUGH THE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS LEAVES USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

# ABSTRACT
This study experimented a program that aims to
classify if a lanzones tree bears a native or duko variety
based on its leaves. 216 leaves for each lanzones variety were
gathered and harvested from Nagcarlan Laguna to serve
as the paper’s dataset. The researchers used Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) as their training model to classify
the 216 leaf samples gathered from two variety of lanzones
trees which then offered a 92.59% validation accuracy and
a 97.84% training accuracy. Using the provided testing data
set, the model’s evaluation was demonstrated. This had an
accuracy rate of 91.66 percent for classifying lanzones leaves.
